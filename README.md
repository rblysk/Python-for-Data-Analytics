# PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYTICS

**SPECIALIZATION: PROGRAMMING AND EDA WITH PYTHON**

**GRADED TASK**

-----

For this specialization, you learned the **basics of Python** and the packages designed to work with datasets: **Pandas and NumPy.** 

You were also introduced to visualization packages: **Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.**

Now is time to combine these skills into an DA project. 

Your task is to analyze data with Python and **create a notebook**, where you can show your Python and analytical skills.

-----

**The Minimum Requirements for the Graded Task**
* Use Python data types: a list, a dictionary, an array, a dataframe.
* Use Python functions to work with a dataset: join, filter, delete elements, etc.
* Use Numpy and Pandas packages.
* Use at least one package for visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
* Use at least 3 different charts in your project.

-----

A part of your project is to choose a problem to analyze and find a dataset. 

If you want to skip that part, you can use data provided by Turing College in BigQuery or any dataset from the learning material.

To make your life even easier, you can replicate one of your previous projects you completed with SQL, Spreadsheets or Data Studio. 

Please note that even though you can replicate your own project done with other tools, you may not copy and paste a previous notebook from the course with small modifications.

-----

**Evaluation Criteria**

* Minimum requirements are fulfilled: used different data types, used functions to handle datasets, used Numpy, Pandas and any of the visualizations package: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
  
* Followed structured approach to data analysis.
  
* Quality of Python code.
